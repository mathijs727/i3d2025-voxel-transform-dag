# DAG Attribute Compression

This repository acts as a playing ground for experimenting with attribute compression in Sparse Voxel Directed Acyclic Graphs (SVDAGs) and other forms of DAGs (e.g. quadtrees). The initial project template was copied from [Jason Turners C++ starter project](https://github.com/cpp-best-practices/cpp_starter_project).

## Building from source
This project is actively developed on Windows, however Linux & MacOS support should work with minor modifications. To build the code you will need a C++ 20 compatible compiler, CMake, and [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/) package manager. To install vcpkg, follow the steps on the [getting started page](https://vcpkg.io/en/getting-started.html).
